# Case Bookings
Cases are created at the contact stage of a users journey. When the user selects `Submit details`, the full payload is sent to the 
CLA backend endpoint which via `post_case`. This sends the full payload to backend with all required information including information 
provided on the contact us form.

### Case reference
The case reference is provided when the endpoint is called. This is then updated in the session to be provided on the confirmation page 
by:

```python
session["case_reference"] = cla_backend.post_case(payload=payload)["reference"]
```

This in turn also posts the case to CLA Backend.

### Reason for contacting
When a user goes directly to Contact Us via the Reasons for Contacting form, the payload only creates a case with a 
case number and the selections on the reasons for contacting form.

This is handled by the RFC `MODEL_REF_SESSION_KEY` to determine whether the user has followed this journey instead.


### Email confirmation
On contact us submission, if a user has provided an email address a confirmation email is sent. The email is sent via our email 
orchestrator found at:
```
https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa_govuk_notify_orchestrator
```

The confirmation email uses the case reference generated to attach to the email to further help the users. Dependant on the user 
selections on the contact us page, a specific template is used.
