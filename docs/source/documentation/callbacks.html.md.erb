# Callbacks

When a user books a callback from the call centre, a system is in place to ensure call handlers have enough capacity.

There are a few notes in regards to callbacks:

- Callbacks are provided to users for the next week (8 days, today + 7)
- Thirdparty callback slots have no limit
- In the case where all non-thirdparty callbacks are booked for today or the week, a message is displayed on the contact us page with the options removed

## Callback slots

The slots for the period are provided via the CLA Backend using the `get_time_slots(num_days=8, is_third_party_callback=False)` 
function.

This function probes the endpoint: `checker/api/v1/callback_time_slots/`

This outputs a JSON with the slots for the period which can then be used in our service.

On our service, slots are controlled by the `_setup_callback_time_choices` function. This uses the `_format_slots_by_day` function to 
transform the json data into day slots.

## Callback Capping

Slots to the call centre for callbacks are controlled via CLA Backend. Either a CSV is uploaded with the upcoming timeslot capacity 
or a user can manually update.

Once slots are filled, options will be reduced on the contact us form. Slot availability handling is dealt with in the contact form 
via `_adjust_contact_options_for_availability`.
