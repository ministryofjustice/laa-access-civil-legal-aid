# Fast Tracking Users

When users follow certain journey's they are immediately taken to the contact us page.

Although this journey is recorded in the URL, no additional information is passed to the CLA Backend.

This additional URL information is used as part of our analytics for user fast track reasons. 

## Adding fast track

To add a fast track to a routing map, include both the endpoint and reason like so:

```python
{"endpoint": "contact.contact_us_fast_tracked", "reason": "harm"}
```

If you are needing to add a fast track URL in a HTML it can be done as so: 

```html
href={{ url_for('contact.contact_us_fast_tracked', reason='other') }}
```

## Reasons for fast track

Currently there are the below reasons for fast track:

| Reason |
| -------------------|
| harm   |
| more-info-required |
| other  |

Any url that does not include a fast track reason will default to `other`.
