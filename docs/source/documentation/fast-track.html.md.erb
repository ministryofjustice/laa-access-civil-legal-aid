# Fast Tracking Users

When users follow certain journey's they are immediately taken to the contact us page.

Although this journey is recorded in the URL, no additional information is passed to the CLA Backend.

This additional URL information is used as part of our analytics for user fast track reasons. 

## Adding fast track

To add a fast track to a routing map, include both the endpoint and reason like so:

```python
{"endpoint": "contact.contact_us_fast_tracked", "reason": "harm"}
```

If you are needing to add a fast track URL in a HTML it can be done as so: 

```html
href={{ url_for('contact.contact_us_fast_tracked', reason='other') }}
```

## Reasons for fast track

These are the current valid fast track reasons:

| Constant           | Reason |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| `HARM`             |User has indicated they are at risk of harmv
| `MORE_INFO_REQUIRED` |Further scoping information is required|
| `OTHER `           |Other|

If no fast track reason is provided the reason will default to `OTHER`.
