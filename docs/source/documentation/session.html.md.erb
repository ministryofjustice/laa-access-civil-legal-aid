# Session Data

A large portion of the user journey is handled via the session and used in the payload during submission.

The class Session is stored in app/session. It contains multiple functions to assist in diagnosising users and also 
to help display the correct information on the screen.

Session information is cleared once the user reaches the confirmation page or if the user navigates away from Check.
