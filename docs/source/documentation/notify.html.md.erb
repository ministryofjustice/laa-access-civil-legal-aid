# Notify Emails

All of our email orchestration across all services is handled via our email orchestrator found at this [link](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa_govuk_notify_orchestrator).

As part of this project, the notify API connections are set in the app/contact/notify/api.py. 

Our service uses the `NotifyEmailOrchestrator` object to handle all requests to the API.

## Sending an email
Emails are typically sent with the `create_and_send_confirmation_email` function as exampled below:

```python
notify.create_and_send_confirmation_email(
    email_address,
    session["case_reference"],
    session["callback_time"],
    session["contact_type"],
    form.data.get("full_name"),
    form.data.get("thirdparty_full_name"),
    form.data.get("contact_number"),
    form.data.get("thirdparty_contact_number"),
)
```

The `send_email` function is currently used as a helper function but can be used to send emails directly without parameters.
Emails can only be sent if TESTING is set to False.

## Templates

All emails sent to the Notify Orchestrator require a template to be provided which are currently set in app/contact/notify/api/templates.

To update templates or retrieve their id's, head to the [notify website](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/).

You can request a new account via the notify support.
