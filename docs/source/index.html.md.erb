# Check if you can get legal aid

Check if you can get legal aid is a public facing service available on GOV.UK which gives members of the public clear guidance
on whether they can receive civil legal aid for their problem, and provides guidance and next steps tailored to their outcome.

The service provides a route for users to raise a case and optionally book an appointment with the Civil Legal Advice (CLA) call centre if their problem is in-scope for Civil Legal Advice
and if the user is financially eligible for legal aid, however, the financial eligibility check may be skipped at this stage in certain cases.

The application is split into three main components:

- Category traversal, responsible for diagnosing whether a user's problem is in-scope for civil legal aid.
- Means test, responsible for checking if a user financially qualifies for legal aid.
- Contact, allows the user to raise their case with the CLA call centre and optionally book a callback.
